This project is a simulation-based lie detector created using the C programming language.
It asks the user a set of predefined yes/no questions, measures how long the user takes to answer each question, compares the answer with the expected truthful answer, and decides whether the answer looks truthful or a possible lie.

Although it does not use real psychological or biometric lie-detection techniques, it demonstrates how string handling, timing, structures, dynamic memory, and decision-making work in C.
