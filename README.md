# C-MAJOR-PROJECT
LIE DETECTOR SYSTEM
This project is a simple lie detector simulation developed in the C programming language.
It asks a user a set of yes/no questions and analyzes two main factors:

Whether the user’s answer matches the expected (truthful) answer

How much time the user took to respond

If the answer is wrong or the user takes more than a threshold time to answer (e.g., 3 seconds), the program marks that response as a Possible Lie.

The project simulates the basic logic behind a lie detector by assuming that:

Truthful answers are usually quick
Incorrect or delayed answers may indicate hesitation (possible lying)

It does not measure real biometric data but provides a logic-based simulation suitable for C programming practice.
